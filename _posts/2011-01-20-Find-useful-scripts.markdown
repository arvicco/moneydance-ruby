## Finding useful Ruby scripts

[Sample Ruby scripts](http://github.com/arvicco/moneydance-ruby/tree/master/examples) may
give you some ideas about what is possible to achieve and how to go about achieving it.

Sample Python scripts that are found on [Moneydance Dev pages](http://moneydance.com/developer)
can be useful as templates, since they use same underlying Moneydance API and can be
often converted into Ruby scripts with minimal modification.

[Moneydance Dev pages](http://moneydance.com/developer) also contain useful resources
and links for developers.

You can help the community if you [share](/moneydance-ruby/2011/01/21/Share-my-Scripts.html)
your own scripts with other Moneydance users.
