## Sharing your Ruby scripts with the community

You can help the community by sharing your own scripts with other Moneydance users.
There are several ways to do it (ordered from easiest to more advanced):

- [Send me](http://github.com/inbox/new/arvicco) your script, and I'll put it into
  a main repository for everyone to appreciate
- Publish your code on [Gist](https://gist.github.com) and create a comment with
  link to it below
- [Fork](https://github.com/arvicco/moneydance-ruby#fork_box) Moneydance Ruby on Github,
  clone it locally, put your scripts into "examples" dir, push and send me a pull
  request
