## Moneydance API documentation

[Moneydance API docs](http://moneydance.com/dev/apidoc/index.html) are primary source of
developers information. Ruby interface allows you to use Moneydance API classes and
methods in your Ruby scripts.

[Moneydance Dev pages](http://moneydance.com/developer) also contain useful resources
and links for developers.

If you need help with Moneydance API,
[Moneydance Developers forum](http://help.infinitekind.com/discussions/moneydance-development)
is a good place to start.

## Moneydance Ruby documentation

You should be familiar with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en) to be able to write
scripts.

Moneydance Ruby is [JRuby](http://www.jruby.org) and its interactive console is
derived from Jirb_swing. [JRuby wiki](http://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki) contains a
wealth of information about accessing Java APIs from Ruby scripts.

[Moneydance Ruby Primer](/moneydance-ruby/2011/01/10/Work-with-Moneydance-API.html)
highlights some of the useful methods and approaches to programmatically accessing
Moneydance. Please read it to understand how you can interact with Moneydance data
structures and interfaces from Ruby.

Possibilities are limitless, this is Ruby - play with data models interactively, read
the reference docs and hack away.
